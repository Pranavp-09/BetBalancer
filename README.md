# **BetBalancer - Perfect Balance Between Risk and Reward**  

## **Introduction**  
Hi everyone, Iâ€™m **Atharv**, and I created this project to help optimize investments in IPL betting on platforms like Stake. The idea for this project came from my close friend **Pranav Pharande**, who uses a strategic approach to **minimize losses** and **maximize profits** while betting. However, manually calculating the optimal investment for each team can be time-consuming and error-prone.  

To solve this **real-life problem**, I built this **responsive and user-friendly** website where users can simply enter the **current betting odds** for both teams. The tool then calculates and provides the **optimal investment amounts**, helping users make **data-driven decisions** to minimize potential losses and maximize potential profits.  

## **Features**  
- **Automated Calculation**: Enter the current betting prices, and the tool instantly computes how much to invest in each team.  
- **Summary Table**: Displays key metrics including:  
  - **Total Investment**  
  - **Amount to Invest in Team A & Team B**  
  - **Maximum Possible Profit**  
  - **Maximum Possible Loss**  
- **Responsive & User-Friendly Interface**: The website is designed to work seamlessly across different devices, ensuring a smooth user experience.  
- **Real-Life Problem Solving**: This project addresses a **genuine challenge** faced by betting enthusiasts by simplifying complex calculations into a **one-click solution**.  

## **Disclaimer**  
ðŸš¨ **This project is purely for educational and personal use.** I do not encourage betting or investment in any form. If you choose to use this tool, you do so **at your own risk**. Always gamble responsibly!
