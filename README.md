# IPL Betting Investment Calculator  

## Introduction  
Hi everyone, Iâ€™m **Atharv**, and I created this project to help optimize investments in IPL betting on platforms like Stake. The idea for this project came from my close friend **Pranav Pharande**, who uses a strategic approach to minimize losses and maximize profits while betting. However, calculating the optimal amount to invest in each team manually can be time-consuming.  

To automate this process, I built this **static website** where users can simply enter the **current betting odds** for both teams. The tool then calculates and provides the **optimal investment amounts** to minimize potential losses and maximize potential profits.  

## Features  
- **Automated Calculation**: Enter the current betting prices, and the tool instantly computes how much to invest in each team.  
- **Summary Table**: Displays key metrics including:  
  - Total Investment  
  - Amount to Invest in **Team A** & **Team B**  
  - Maximum Possible Profit  
  - Maximum Possible Loss  

## Disclaimer  
ðŸš¨ **This project is purely for educational and personal use.** I do not encourage betting or investment in any form. If you choose to use this tool, you do so **at your own risk**. Always gamble responsibly!
